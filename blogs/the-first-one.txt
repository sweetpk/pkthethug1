You know what’s funny?

If I read this five years ago, I would’ve laughed. I would’ve mocked myself. This version of me. The one writing this. The one spiraling. The one sitting here, realizing—no, admitting—that maybe, just maybe, he isn’t built different. That he isn’t special. That he isn’t some prodigy who was always meant for greatness.

If I told my past self that at 22, he’d be watching the thing he built collapse in slow motion, he would have scoffed and said, nah, impossible. I’d never let it come to that.

And yet.

Here we fucking are.

Pixacity is dying. Or dead. Or somewhere in between—whatever you call that stage where something hasn’t fully stopped breathing, but you can already see the end. It’s not the kind of failure that happens overnight. It’s worse. It’s the kind that stretches over months, over a year, slow decay where you keep telling yourself, I just need to push harder, but somewhere inside, you already know.

And that’s the worst part.

The knowing.

The creeping realization that maybe all those sleepless nights, all those this will be worth it pep talks, all those moments where I believed I was different, were just delusions.

Because if I was really different, if I was really built for this, shouldn’t I have figured it out by now? Shouldn’t I have done something? Shouldn’t Pixacity be something real, something undeniable, something that proves I was never just another overambitious kid hyped up on his own ideas?

I was supposed to be ahead.

But I’m behind.

Let’s get something straight—I never looked down on people who took the traditional route. Not once. I studied in the best college in the country, surrounded by absolute fucking geniuses. People who were grinding their way into investment banking, research, startups, shit that actually mattered.

I never thought I was better than them. But I did think I was different.

And maybe that was worse.

Because in my head, they were following maps—proven paths, structured roads leading to success. And I was forging my own fucking road from scratch.

That felt noble. That felt superior in a way that I never admitted, even to myself. Because anyone can follow a system, right? But to build something completely new? To create something from nothing? That takes vision.

I told myself that’s what set me apart. Not grades, not intelligence, not connections—vision.

And that’s the thing about vision—it’s fucking useless if you never reach the point where others can see it too.

Because now, my so-called vision is nothing but a graveyard of half-executed ideas and unfinished projects. It’s a lingering what-if. It’s potential—that cursed, mocking word. The thing people say when you haven’t actually achieved shit, but they don’t want to call you a failure outright.

I spent years thinking I was ahead.

Now I’m looking around and realizing they’re winning.

Not in some abstract, capitalist way. Not in some they have money, I don’t way. But in the simple, undeniable fact that they are doing things that matter. They are creating, succeeding, thriving.

And I?

I am staring at a crumbling project that was supposed to define me.

So what the fuck do I do now?

There’s a version of me that gives up. Just packs it in, walks away, accepts that he was just another guy who overestimated himself. I can picture it—taking some stable job, telling people at parties, “Yeah, I once worked on this metaverse thing,” and watching their polite, unimpressed nods.

I think that’s the real nightmare. Not just failing. But becoming someone who talks about what he could have been.

I’d rather fucking choke.

But that leaves me with the only other option. The harder option.

To keep going.

Not because I have some delusional belief that I’m still destined for greatness. But because I refuse to accept the alternative. Because the only way I’ll ever know if I was right about myself—if I actually had something in me—is if I refuse to stop before I have my answer.

And yeah, sure. Maybe I’ll never find it. Maybe I’ll fail at this, and the next thing, and the next. Maybe I’ll look back at this years from now and laugh at how dramatic and fucking stupid I was for even thinking I had a shot.

But at least I’ll know I tried.

At least I won’t have to live with the unbearable, soul-rotting shame of quitting before I even knew what I was capable of.

And that? That’s worth something.

Maybe not meaning. Maybe not destiny.

But something.

And maybe, for now, that’s enough.
