He wakes before dawn,
the sky still dreaming of stars
his hands already reaching
for things that glow but never warm.

Every step is measured, neat,
the kind they call promising.
He builds his days like tall glass towers,
and stands beneath their shade.

Some people applaud.
Their voices echo, hollow
a thousand coins dropped
in an empty well of praise.

He smiles like sunlight on metal,
bright, cold, rehearsed.
His laughter learned
from the mouths of others.

He once looked at her
the way trees look at rain,
but she was the cloud
that never poured.

Sometimes, he wonders
where all the warmth goes
the joy that once spilled easy,
now fading quietly in the storm of his own making,
until all that’s left of him falls softly,
like tears in rain.

And when night comes,
it finds him wide awake,
listening to the hum of what could’ve been
that quiet, patient nothing
that always knows his name.

So he keeps walking,
past the gardens he planted,
past the dreams still shining on his skin
a golden boy fading slow,
elegantly,
like watching a beautiful sunset… at noon.
