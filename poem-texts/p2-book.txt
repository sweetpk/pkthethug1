Papa, can I buy this book?
Sure, but have you even had a look?
Yes, Papa, I’ve read the name - Alexander the Great!
He smiled and said, Good, son… it’s never too late
History will ‘teach you all about life,' he told me then,
And I believed him, like only a child can.

I was already in love with men who carried crowns and swords,
With Alexander, Napoleon, names bigger than words.
I thought battles were just stories where heroes shined bright,
I didn’t know what it meant to burn cities in the night.
I only knew that history felt warm and grand to me,
Like a picture of glory I was lucky to see.

But then I started reading a little more closely than before
What did Caesar really have, if not his friend’s knife at his throat?
Leonidas and his 300 didn’t fall to the Persians in the end,
But to Ephialtes - their own trusted friend.
The more I read, the more I began to see
History wasn’t glory… it was betrayal teaching me.

All my life I saw history repeat in small, quiet ways
Lives breaking because someone spoke too much in a bad phase.
Relationships ending over lust no one could hide,
Friendships dying the moment ego walked inside.
History ruined kingdoms, people ruin each other the same,
Just different faces playing the same old game.

Imagine Austerlitz, and it scares me still
What if I’m not Napoleon, but the first soldier they kill?
One of the thousands whose names the dust will keep,
One who fought, bled, fell, and went to sleep.
Why would life choose me to be the one who leads,
And not the one forgotten in the weeds?

Wheel of life turns, and I tried building something grand,
A dream I held tightly with both my hands.
But it fell apart, and there was no Paris to blame
Just my own ashes, rising in the flame.
Like Hector, I gave it all for my little Troy,
And still watched it burn, silent, without joy.

I once felt for someone, or thought I did,
But it played out like Napoleon and Josephine did.
Warm one day, cold the next, always out of reach,
Close enough to follow, too distant to breach.
She didn’t break an emperor, but she hollowed me all the same
Quiet presence, quiet ache, no one left to blame.

I met people I thought were finally my own,
Friends who felt like a place I had grown.
But pride is poison that whispers “you deserve more”,
Until you push aside the ones you swore to adore.
I watch them build their Ides of March by hand,
Killing their Caesars, with no one left to understand.

My pain is knowing things before they start
Patterns flown in history, beat in every heart.
The same mistakes, the same betrayal and fear,
The same old tragedies appearing year after year.
Every friend is Arthur and Lancelot until a Guinevere comes along,
Every Belisarius, waits for a Justinian to prove him wrong.

As a kid, I cried like Siddhartha seeing suffering on the street,
Every disabled man felt like a story I couldn’t read.
But life hardens you in ways you never choose,
You learn to look away so your soul doesn’t bruise.
Even Buddha couldn’t fix the world - only his mind,
And maybe, that’s the peace I could never find.

I still recall that fair, that book, that day;
Papa saying history would teach me life’s way.
And it did… but the cost was too deep for my age,
Knowledge steals your peace page by page.
You start seeing battles where others see life,
Like Atlas’s curse, heavy enough to break the spine.

Now I dream of that moment again - but me as a father this time,
My son holding Alexander, eyes bright as this rhyme.
“Papa, can I buy this book?” he asks with a grin,
And I smile softly, knowing where that road has been.
So I buy him a funny comic instead, not a book of a king,
Maybe he doesn’t need to learn, everything.
